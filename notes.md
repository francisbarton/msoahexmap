come up with a way of measuring efficiency at different hex sizes
(per region)
- how many hexes does it take to cover the whole geographical area?
- how many of these are used at different hex sizes? (%, efficiency)
- what is the average distance of a hex centroid from the geo MSOA centroid at different hex sizes? (accuracy)

find the hex size that gives the best balance between efficiency and accuracy across all regions
